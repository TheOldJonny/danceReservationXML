# danceReservationXML
This project is addressed to Italian friends that want to handle the club reservations in XML files. It is just for fun! =D The GUI is written in Python, using the CustomTkinter framework


If you just want to use it, you can just download the dist archive. Decompress it, go in the gui folder and double click the gui.exe. I has been tested on Windows 10.

You can also edit the source code as you please, and share some tips.
